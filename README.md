## Hey there! 👋

I'm **Keerat**, a Data Science & AI student based in India.

I like building things and figuring out how they work.  
If an idea sticks in my head, chances are I’ll try to turn it into a project and see how far it goes.

My main interests revolve around machine learning, reinforcement learning, and systems, and I enjoy experimenting with Python and Linux-based workflows. I like learning by building, breaking things, and improving them over time.

I’ve worked on a few projects so far, mostly focused on ML and RL, and I’m always exploring new ideas and directions.

### Fun facts:
- I enjoy reading books and comics  
- I play guitar in my free time  
- I like writing and sketching occasionally  
- I have a dog 🐶  
- I prefer building things over just reading about them
